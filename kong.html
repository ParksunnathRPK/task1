        <p><b>Kong</b> is a fictional giant monster, or kaiju, resembling a gorilla, 
            who has appeared in various media since 1933. Dubbed the King of the Beasts 
            from its inception, over time it would also be bestowed the title of the Eighth Wonder 
            of the World, a widely recognized expression within the franchise. His first appearance was 
            in the novelization of the 1933 film 
            King Kong from RKO Pictures, with the film premiering a little over two months later.</p>
